        <p>Getting to live each and every day knowing that im yours itself is a huge blessing for me. You make me so happy. Nobody has ever made me feel this special and loved. Youre really a great boyfriend. I know we're gonna make it. I'm really sure. I mean, just look at us. We've fought so many times. We've said many things. We've did many things. And yet we decided to make ourselves better, forgive each other and live happily. Im so grateful and happy you're in my life. Just thinking bout our future gets me all excited and had me kickin my feet. You're really such an adorable person. You are so kind and patient. You're willing to learn and grow. You're genuine and honest. You support me a lot. What more could i ask for? I literally have the man of my dreams. I wanted to marry a good man. And im really really happy knowing that i will. And im even more happy knowing that its you. I hope we get to make a lot of memories and do a lot of naughty stuffs hehe. I love you so much baby. I really love you a lot. Mwaaaahhh!!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüéÄ </p>
